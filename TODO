BASIC STRATEGY

step 1: calculate basic NPVs

step 2: iterate on the NPVs

we need 
  - decide that takes NPVs + state of board and outputs a probability
  - play that takes decide and plays the game. every time someone needs to make
    a decision they will just call decide. the game should keep track of how
    much each square earns over the course of the game and output an NPV
    at the end of the game
  - we can then iterate: a set of NPVs goes in, a set of NPVs comes out
